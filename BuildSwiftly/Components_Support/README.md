#  Components_Support

## Overview

Any files that are being used by more than one of the component APIs should be stored here and placed into their own subfolder. At the root of the subfolder, there should be a *required* `.swift` file containing the codebase to the component, an *optional* subfolder containing any files used by the component, and an *optional* README.
